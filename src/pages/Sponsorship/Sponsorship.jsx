                    Mars Rover Manipal is a leading student project team of Manipal Academy of Higher Education. With each subsequent year, the team has built a better, more capable design with a better performance than the previous one. The team has been a consistent performer in University Rover Challenge, organized by Mars Society. Mars Society is the body concerned with the establishment of humans on Mars in future. The event is judged and attended by leading scientists of the world. Tech heads from all over the world, who will one day be leading technocrats, take part in the event. Our partner sponsors are featured in our merchandise which we wear in all our events. Our logo also has stickers of our sponsor companies. We sponsors from time to time on our social platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Youtube. Besides the competition, we put our work on display at TechTatva, MIT's national level technical festival. A fest with a reach like such can be a great platform for your company for advertisement. We regularly take part in tech competitions, where our rover has constantly performed well.
